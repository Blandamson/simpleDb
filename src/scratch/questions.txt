1. What does page number mean, and can we assume that the page number corresponds to the order in which the page was
serialized? Relevant to implementation of HeapFile.readPage(). If the pages aren't serialized in order of page number
how can you fetch a specific page from disc given a pageId without loading the whole heapFile into memory?

2. How can the HeapFile iterator get a comprehensive list of pageId's that belong to a given heapFile to feed into
 BufferPool.getPage()?
